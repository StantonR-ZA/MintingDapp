            In Zulu/Xhosa mythology the Tokoloshe is a dwarf-like water sprite. It is considered a mischievous and evil spirit that can become invisible by drinking water or swallowing a stone. Tokoloshes are called upon by malevolent people to cause trouble for others. The can might be banished by a Sangoma, who has the power to expel it from the area. <br /><br/>
            The Tokoloshe can be killed by piercing a hot nail into the hole in its head. Attempts have been made at its life by placing other objects in the hole as well.
